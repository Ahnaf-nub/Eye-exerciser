# Eye Exerciser - Eye Movement Detection and Guidance
## Overview
Eye Exerciser is a desktop application built using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter that assists users in exercising their eyes by detecting and guiding eye movements in real-time. The application prompts users to move their eyes in specific directions (right, left, up, down) and uses a webcam feed to track the user's eye movements to ensure they are following the guidance correctly.

## Features
Real-Time Eye Movement Detection: Utilizes OpenCV's Hough Circle Transform and Haar Cascades to detect eye movements in real-time.
Interactive GUI: A user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, providing visual feedback and instructions for eye exercises.
Step-by-Step Guidance: Prompts users to move their eyes in different directions and verifies if the movement was performed correctly.
